# (Getting Started) Installing VSCode

Before we begin, let's first get ourselves a good editor. A good editor with the right packages makes coding an enjoyable experience!

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my preferred editor of choice. It's seamless, has a good out-of-the-box experience, and it's also snappy! :rocket:

You can download VSCode from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Once you've downloaded VSCode, there is one extension that I would highly recommend, and that is the Atom Keymap for VSCode. This adds the Atom key bindingsm which I've found rather nice, especially for a Mac user :smile:

To install this, click on the *Extension* icon on the left navigation bar (it's the last icon on the list), and search for `Atom Keymap` and install it.

Done? Cool! Let's get started then! :smile:
